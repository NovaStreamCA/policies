            <h1>Password Policy and Documentation</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>

                <p>At NovaStream, we prioritize the security of our digital assets and recognize that passwords play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information. This policy aims to establish strong password practices to mitigate potential risks and protect our systems from unauthorized access.</p>
                <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>

                <p>This policy covers all systems and data within the NovaStream network, including servers, databases, applications, and user data. Also, this policy may cover data located on third party servers, databases and applications utilized by NovaStream.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Requirements</h2>

                <h3>2.1 Complexity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passwords must be atleast 12 characters long.</li>
                    <li>Passwords must include a combination of the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uppercase letters (A-Z)</li>
                            <li>Lowercase letters (a-z)</li>
                            <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
                            <li>Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="my-3"><em>You can exclude ambigious characters (e.g., L, l, i, I, 0, o) that may have trouble interpreting on different screens or fonts.</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Reuse</h3>

                <p>Users are prohibited from using the same or a similiar password across different services or platforms. This includes your email password.</p>

                <p>The use of unique passwords for NovaStream systems and any connected third-party services is mandatory.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Password Rotations</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Frequency</h3>
                <p>As per 2023 NIST 800-63 guidelines, we do not recommend any enforcement on password rotations or dates of mandatory password changes.</p>

                <p>NIST recommends that businesses enforce password expiration and password resets only when a known compromise has occurred, or every 365 days.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Reuse</h3>
                <p>Users cannot reuse any of their last five (5) passwords. If the option is available in the software or platform, it must be enabled.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Account Lockouts</h2>

                <p>When possible, enable account locking after multiple failed attempts.</p>

                <h3>4.1 Timespan</h3>
                <p> If the application or service allows, five (5) failures in a short timespan should lock the account for a minimum of 30 minutes. This should be reviewed based on the priority of the account.</p>
                <h3>4.2 Notification</h3>
                <p>If possible, enable notification of account lockout to the account owner.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)</h2>

                <p>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) codes are temporary, time-sensitive passcodes generated during the login process. Typically delivered through methods like SMS, authenticator apps, or push notifications, these codes provide an additional layer of security by requiring users to enter a second factor, along with their password, for authentication.</p>

                <p>We encourage the use of multi-factor authentication of atleast two (2) factors for additional layers of security.</p>

                <h3>5.1 Recommended Factors</h3>

                <h3>5.2 Priority</h3>
                <p>When available, use the following factors in order for increased security.</p>

                <h3>5.3 MFA Fatigue</h3>
                <p>Be wary of MFA attempts when mutliple requests come in, or at odd times. Contact the security team if you are receiving MFA requests not requested by you. Do not allow if you are unsure it was requested by you.</p>

                <h3>5.4 Backup Codes</h3>

                <p>2FA recovery/backup codes are static, pre-generated backup codes intended for use when a user is unable to access their primary 2FA method. Unlike dynamic 2FA codes, recovery codes remain constant and are securely stored by the user. When needed, it serves as a reliable fallback mechanism in case of emergencies or when the primary authentication method is unavailable.</p>

                <h4>5.4.1 Storage</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recovery codes used to restore access to an account <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be stored in a password manager or in a document, spreadsheet, etc on a computer.</li>
                    <li>Recovery codes should be written or printed off, labelled, dated and stored in a secure location.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5.4.3 Rotations</h4>
                <p>Recovery codes should be changed based on the "Password Rotation" section in this document.</p>

                <h2>6. Storage &amp; Providing Access</h2>

                <h3>6.1 Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passwords must be stored securely using industry-standard encryption methods.</li>
                    <li>We encourage the use of a password manager such as BitWarden as well as enabling 2FA on that account.</li>
                    <li>Avoid storing passwords in plaintext such as in documents, emails, or spreadsheets.</li>
                    <li>When developing software that requires passwords, passwords must be stored as a hash in the database or storage provider.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.2 Providing Access</h3>

            </section>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>9. Password Recovery</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Platforms and software that require an account utilized or created by NovaStream must provide a secure and reliable password recovery process, ensuring it doesn't compromise security.</li>
                    <li>Password recovery requested by clients must be sent in writing by the user of the account from the email address associated with the account or by an authorized member of the company. A secondary confirmation should be requested to reduce impersonation or phishing attacks.</li>
                </ul>
