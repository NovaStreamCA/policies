            <h1>Backup Policy and Documentation</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>

                <p>The purpose of this document is to define the backup strategy, procedures, and guidelines to safeguard the integrity and availability of NovaStream's and their respective client's critical data.</p>
                <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>

                <p>This policy covers all systems and data within the NovaStream network, including servers, databases, applications, and user data. Also, this policy may cover third party servers, databases and applications utilized by NovaStream.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Backup Strategy</h2>

                <p>We utilize the 3-2-1-1 rule, which is a data backup strategy designed to ensure the creation of reliable and secure backups for data protection and disaster recovery purposes. The rule provides a straightforward and effective guideline for creating backup copies that are resilient against various risks, including hardware failures, data corruption, and disasters.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 Copies</strong><br>This includes the original data and two additional backup copies. This provides redundancy in case one copy becomes inaccessible or corrupted.</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Different Media Types</strong><br>Data stored on a different type of media to reduce chances of hardware failures or data corruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>1 Offsite Copy</strong><br>This provides protection against events such as natural disasters, theft, or other on-premises incidents that could affect all copies stored in the same physical location.</li>
                    <li><strong>1 Airgapped Copy</strong><br>This copy is kept disconnected from the network when not actively being updated, providing protection against cyber threats and ransomware.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We capture all data associated with your account located in your folder as well as any databases unless you have opted out.<br>To opt-out, please reach out to your account manager.</p>
                <p><strong>We highly encourage you to implement your own backup strategy for your data stored with us on a regular basis.</strong></p>

                <h3>2.1 Backup Storage</h3>
                <h4>2.1.1 Onsite</h4>

                <p>We securely store your backups on a server located within our office.</p>

                <h4>2.1.2 Offsite</h4>

                <p>We utilize DigitalOcean as our offsite storage provider to keep our backups securely offsite.</p>

                <h4>2.2.3 Cloud</h4>
                <p>We utilize BackBlaze B2 as our offsite storage provider to keep our backups securely in the cloud.</p>
                <p>All files are transmitted using an encrypted TLS connection. We also add our own encryption to your files before transmitting them to Backblaze B2. All transmitted files are stored encrypted at rest inside a private bucket with our own encryption as well as <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/bb/docs/cloud-storage-server-side-encryption" target="_blank">server side encryption</a> provided by BackBlaze.</p>


                <h4>2.2.4 Airgapped</h4>

                <h3>2.2 Retention Policy</h3>
                <p>Due to the small size of database (SQL) backups for our client's websites, we may retain these files for longer periods, for additional protection for the customer.</p>

                <h4>2.1.1 Onsite</h4>
                <p>Depending on available storage capacity, full backups are also retained on our local storage for up-to <strong>31 days</strong>.</p>
                <h4>2.1.2 Offsite</h4>
                <p>Latest revision of the full backups are retained on our storage provider for <strong>31 days</strong>.</p>
                <h4>2.2.3 Cloud</h4>
                <p>Full backups are also retained on our cloud storage for up-to <strong>31 days</strong>.</p>
                <h4>2.2.4 Airgapped</h4>
                <p>Latest revision of the full backups are retained on airgapped devices for <strong>2 months</strong>.</p>
